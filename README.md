## Features

> The main focus of this repo is making tools to help understand the **Ergo** blockchain in. As a starting point you'll find the **txio-view-react** which tries to map inputs to outputs in a visual appealing way usable within a **React** app.

## Setup

This repo was initially cloned from [Template project for setting up a TypeScript monorepo](https://github.com/NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo).
